# FarmerFroilan Project - Instructor Introduction

## Project Overview
The FarmerFroilan project is a comprehensive Object-Oriented Programming exercise designed to challenge 
students with real-world design complexities, specifically focusing on **multiple inheritance design patterns** 
and **Test-Driven Development** practices. 
Students will model a complete farm ecosystem with interconnected entities, behaviors, and relationships.

## What Students Will Learn

### üéØ **Primary Learning Objectives**
1. **Complex OOP Design** - Navigate multiple inheritance challenges using interfaces and abstract classes
2. **UML Modeling** - Create comprehensive system diagrams before coding (must get UML approved by instructor!!)
3. **Test-Driven Development** - Write extensive unit tests that drive implementation
4. **Generics Application** - Apply generic programming principles for clean, reusable code
5. **System Integration** - Model complex real-world relationships between entities

### üèóÔ∏è **Core Design Challenges**
Students will grapple with entities that wear "multiple hats":
- **Farmer** (Froilan) is simultaneously: Eater, Rider, Botanist, and Person
- **CropDuster** is both: FarmVehicle and Aircraft  
- **Chicken** is both: Animal and Produce (yields eggs)
- **Crops** have complex state management (fertilized/harvested flags)

## Three-Phase Development Approach

### **Phase 1: UML Design (Days 1-2)**
- **Mandatory instructor approval before proceeding**
- Focus on interface hierarchy and inheritance relationships
- Identify composition vs. inheritance decisions
- Plan for generic type implementations

### **Phase 2: Test-Driven Development (Days 3-5)**
- **This is where the real learning happens**
- Simulate a complete work week (Sunday through Tuesday detailed scenarios)
- Achieve minimum 80% test coverage
- Tests should drive all implementation decisions

### **Phase 3: Implementation (Days 6-7)**
- **Surprisingly straightforward** once tests are comprehensive
- Focus on making tests pass rather than over-engineering
- Refactor for clean, maintainable code

## Weekly Focus Areas

### **Days 1-2: Design & Planning**
üîç **Student Focus:**
- Map all inheritance relationships carefully
- Identify shared behaviors (NoiseMaker, Eater, Rideable)
- Plan generic implementations for collections
- **Get UML approved - no exceptions!**

### **Days 3-5: Test Creation**
üß™ **Student Focus:**
- Create separate test classes for each day scenario
- Test morning routines (riding horses, feeding, breakfast)
- Test work activities (planting, fertilizing, harvesting)
- Verify state changes (fertilized flags, harvested crops)
- Mock complex interactions between entities

### **Days 6-7: Implementation & Integration**
‚öôÔ∏è **Student Focus:**
- Let tests guide implementation
- Don't over-complicate - make tests green
- Pay attention to generic type safety
- Ensure clean separation of concerns

## Key Success Metrics

### **Technical Mastery Indicators:**
- ‚úÖ Clean interface hierarchy without implementation dependencies
- ‚úÖ Proper generic usage for type safety
- ‚úÖ 80%+ test coverage with meaningful assertions
- ‚úÖ Successful simulation of multi-day farm operations
- ‚úÖ No code smells (proper encapsulation, single responsibility)

### **Design Thinking Evidence:**
- Students can explain inheritance vs. composition trade-offs
- Clear justification for interface design decisions  
- Understanding of how TDD influenced their architecture
- Ability to extend the system with new entity types

## Critical Teaching Points

### **Emphasize to Students:**
1. **"Design First, Code Last"** - UML approval exists for a reason
2. **"Tests Tell the Truth"** - If it's hard to test, it's poorly designed
3. **"Multiple Inheritance ‚â† Multiple Problems"** - When designed thoughtfully
4. **"Generics Prevent Runtime Surprises"** - Type safety is your friend

### **Common Pitfalls to Watch:**
- Students rushing to code without proper design
- Over-engineering solutions instead of meeting test requirements
- Ignoring generic type parameters leading to runtime issues
- Creating too many concrete classes instead of leveraging interfaces

## Assessment Opportunities

**Daily Check-ins:**
- Day 2: UML review and approval
- Day 4: Test coverage and scenario completeness review
- Day 6: Code review focusing on design pattern implementation
- Day 7: Final integration and extension exercise

This project bridges the gap between academic OOP concepts and real-world software architecture challenges. Students will emerge with deep appreciation for design-first development and the power of comprehensive testing.
